# Web-Quiz

## Description

This is our fifth challenge of the bootcamp. In a nutshell, the objective of this challenge was to create a work scheduler that changes background colors as per what time of the day it is and persistently keeps information typed if the user clicks the save button on a per line basis.

My approach for this challenge was to develop each function progressively until a had a final product that resembled the expected behaviour.

## Table of Contents

My README is not long in this specific case. But for good practise purposes, I will keep the original framework shown in this example.
